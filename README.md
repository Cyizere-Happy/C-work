# 🚀 C Programming Projects by Happy

Welcome to my collection of **low-level, high-impact C programming projects**.  
From classic **sorting algorithms** to a dynamic **song playlist manager** built with **linked lists**, this repo is a playground of core CS fundamentals and practical data structures — all written in pure C.
